            The feral cat is the most widely distributed terrestrial carnivore.<br>
            Some behaviors of feral cats are commonly observed, although there is
            disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers and researchers on the
            prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid
            humans. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by
            humans, and back away or run when they are able to do so. If trapped,
            they hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out. They remain
            fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral
            cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.
            <br><br>
            Feral kittens can be trapped and socialized, then adopted into a home. The age at
            which a kitten becomes difficult to socialize is not agreed upon, but
            suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age.
